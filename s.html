            <h1 style="color: orangered; text-align:center ;"><u>Saffron</u></h1>
<p style="color: orangered; text-align:center; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">The Indian flag consists of three colours – white, green and deep saffron yellow, also known in India as Kesari.
This shade is featured at the top of the Indian tricolour flag and is said to represent the strength and courage of India as a country – something everyone in India can be proud of.
However, that’s not all – Saffron has even deeper meanings in the Indian culture!
Considering almost 85% of the total population in India are of the Hindu faith, it’s important to consider how saffron is associated with Hinduism and religious culture in India.
Saffron/Kerasi is the most sacred colour in Hinduism. Firstly, it represents fire – by which impurities are burnt. Subsequently, the colour also represents purity in Hindu beliefs.
Due to its rich meaning, saffron is often worn by holy men of Hinduism and symbolises the ‘quest for light’.
With traits that resemble such important and meaningful qualities – both religious and in terms of the country itself, it’s always a good choice for your interior décor!</p>

<p style="color:  orangered; text-align:center; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">While the saffron blend of yellow and orange in the context of the Indian flag has its own connotations specifically, the colours alone are also known for a variety of different connotations.

<p style="color:  orangered; text-align:center; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><u>These includes:</u></p>
<ul style="color: orangered; text-align:center; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">

<li>Warmth: Orange represents warmth, creating an inviting aura.</li>
<li>Freedom: Orange promotes the idea of free thinking and being yourself!</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orangered; text-align:center; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"> All of these are positive traits, so it’s no wonder yellow and orange are seen all over the world as happy, welcoming colours that everyone can enjoy!
